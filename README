This is zero configuration html5 ready template frame for Joomla! CMS.

* it use jQuery, sorry MooTools
* use html5 semantic everywhere it is possible
* use CSS3 as priority

It supposed to be helpful for building templates for peoples who are ready to
hand code everything without rely on automatization which provided with template
frameworks.
Basically it is not supposed to be framework at all, everything is upon you. This
might be good tool to learn how Joomla template works aside of default ones, but as
well into html5/css3/jQuery enviroment.
I just trying to keep everything in KIS way.

Any thoughts and suggestions please mail me on lapshukov@gmail.com
